# Bank-of-Games----Final-Project

Youtube link: https://youtu.be/nWcj2EsrEQk



I wanted to create a bank of games where I could have a main menu and have the user pick the game the wanted to play. I successfully create the Main menu but was unable to call each game when the player clicked on the appropriate button.
When I was creating tic tac toe I was able to draw the board using love.draw and I added 2 images x and o. I was able to move the pictures but couldn't find a way to make them stick. Instead I added 3 images (a blank square, x, and o). Instead of moving the images, I decided to replace the empty images with x and o.
